# WCA-Queries
SQL Queries of the WCA database
The WCA (World Cube Association) database is publically accessable at https://statistics.worldcubeassociation.org/database-query 
You need an account to perform queries, and this is a repository of some I've written. This is a personal project to gradually teach myself SQL!

you can find more info about the tables and export here: https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/export/results
